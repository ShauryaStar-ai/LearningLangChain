A System on Chip (SoC) is an integrated circuit that consolidates
all major components of a computer or electronic system onto a single chip.
It typically combines a processor, memory, input/output ports, and secondary storage interfaces,
making devices more compact and energy-efficient. SoCs are widely used in smartphones, tablets, wearable devices,
and IoT gadgets due to their small size and high performance. By integrating multiple functionalities, they reduce power
consumption and enhance processing speed. As technology advances,
SoCs continue to drive innovation, enabling faster, smarter, and more versatile electronic devices in everyday life.
